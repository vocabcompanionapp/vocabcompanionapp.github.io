How can we help you?

Vocab Companion is a completely free research-backed learning platform designed to help the user master English vocabulary in the most efficient manner possible. It utilizes a spaced-repetition algorithm, based on the Fibonacci sequence, to design a practice schedule best suited for the development of the user's education. No other vocabulary app allows the user to customize their curriculum towards the specific words they want to learn, nor does it give them an opportunity to continuously test and apply what they've learned while receiving instant feedback, which is proven to be the best way to expand vocabulary.
   The quiz feature (accessible via the 'Practice Vocabulary' option on the dashboard) is how the user will crystallize their knowledge. The quiz will cycle through all of your words that are due for practice, based on the spaced-repetition schedule. Each word will be randomly assigned to one of three different styles of question, so that the user becomes more comfortable with their learned vocabulary in different contexts. The user will either:
1) Be given a word, and asked to select the correct definition.
2) Be given a definition, and asked to select the correct word.
3) Be given a definition, and asked to type in the correct word.
   If the user answers a question incorrectly, they will be given feedback and allowed another chance to get the word correct at the end of the quiz. Only once the user gets the word correct will that word advance forward in the practice schedule. This ensures maximum understanding.
   The Word Bank is what will determine the vocabulary that the user will practice, and when they will practice it. The intended use of this app is whenever the user encounters a word they do not understand, they will add it to the word bank and be given the definition, which will commence the spaced-repetition routine for that word. If the user would like to expand their vocabulary more generally, they can use the 'Add 10 Random Words' feature, which automatically builds their word bank and pulls from a database containing the most useful and most often misunderstood words from the English language. Users can also delete any word from the word bank they do not wish to practice anymore.
   Be sure to check the app daily for any words that are due for practice, which will be indicated next to the Practice Vocabulary button in the Home page.
